                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a resilient, hard working man who loves learning new technology stacks in order to continuously
                        improve my development skills.</p>
                    <p>I am skilled and work with the following technologies on a daily basis: <br>
                        Azure DevOps, MEAN Stack, Node-red, Jira, MongoDB, <a href="https://www.goneutrinos.com/" target="_blank">Nuetrinos</a>
                        Studio and a few other technologies.</p>
                    <p>I am self-motivated, well organized and possesses superb communication skills and sound business
                        awareness. I am more than able to work on my own initiative within a vibrant team, and to
                        liaise directly with clients.</p>
                    <p>When I am not working with clients, I teach underpriviledged youth how to code. So far I have
                        successfully taken two people who initially had no prior programming or even computer skills and
                        taught
                        them how to design and develop applications and websites using MEAN Stack in the space of 8 months.
                    </p>
                    <p>They were successfully interviewed and are now interns in <a href="https://www.goneutrinos.com/" target="_blank">
                        Nuetrinos</a>.</p>
